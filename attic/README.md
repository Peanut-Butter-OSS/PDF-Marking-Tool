# Attic

Due to the fact that initial versions of the marking tool did not use proper source control, there are many "version" folders contained in the source code. This simply causes confusion and we are working to remove them.

As part of the v2.0 development project, these old files and folders have been moved to the attic folder where they can be referenced if needed

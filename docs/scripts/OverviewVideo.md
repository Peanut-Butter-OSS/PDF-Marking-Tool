# Overview Video

Hello World

This short video will give you an overview of the PDF Marking Tool in less time than it takes to make a decent cup of tea. Of course, you don't have to pick one or the other. Why not make the cup of tea first and then enjoy it while watching this video.

OK, enough chit-chat, let's get into it..

In the age of online teaching and learning, it has become commonplace to allow students to compile and submit written assignments of many kinds online. Most online learning management systems have great tools in place for marking multiple-choice assignments, but when it comes to written assignments, the options are limited.

The PDF Marking tool is designed to fill this gap by allowing markers to use intuitive PDF annotations to mark assignments right on the page, but also to be able to calculate and upload marks using a automated and repeatable process.

Let me demonstrate:

I'm opening an electronic assignment, submitted as a PDF document. This is done using Adobe Acrobat Pro, because the marking tool is created as a plug-in for Adobe Acrobat.

Once opened, I can open the marking tools which display right alongside all the standard Acrobat tools that I'm familiar with.

The marking tools include:

- A configurable tick tool. This allows me to apply ticks to the assignment, but I can specify how many points each individual tick is worth. In this example 1 tick equals one mark

- A half-tick tool. Sometimes you want to allocate a half-mark. This is done using the half-tick tool

# Overview Video

Hello World

This short video will give you an overview of the PDF Marking Tool in less time than it takes to make a decent cup of tea. Of course, you don't have to pick one or the other. Why not make the cup of tea first and then enjoy it while watching this video.

OK, enough chit-chat, let's get into it..

In the age of online teaching and learning, it has become commonplace to allow students to compile and submit written assignments of many kinds online. Most online learning management systems have great tools in place for marking multiple-choice assignments, but when it comes to written assignments, the options are limited.

The PDF Marking tool is a custom plug-in for Adobe Acrobat that was created to fill this gap by allowing markers to use intuitive PDF annotations to mark assignments right on the page, but also to be able to calculate and upload marks using a automated and repeatable process.

Let me demonstrate:

I'm opening an electronic assignment, submitted as a PDF document. This is done using Adobe Acrobat Pro, because the marking tool is created as a plug-in for Adobe Acrobat.

Once opened, I can open the marking tools which display right alongside all the standard Acrobat tools that I'm familiar with.

The marking tools include: 

- A configurable tick tool. This allows me to apply ticks to the assignment, but I can specify how many points each individual tick is worth. In this example 1 tick equals 1 mark. I'll mark the first 2 questions as correct using the tick tool

- We also have a half-tick tool. Sometimes you want to allocate a half-mark. This is done using the half-tick tool. Although the answer to question 3 is correct - The poem was written by Yeats, were are really looking for the full name "William Butler Yeats", so I'll only give a half mark.

- Lastly we have the cross tool. If an answer is incorrect, the cross tool is used. In our case I'll indicate that the answer to question 4 is incorrect. The correct answer is, of course, "a couplet"

Now we get to a set of tools that are purpose built for long-form answers. They are the Checked Stamp, the Mark Tool, and the Comment Mark Tool.

- The checked stamp does not carry any embedded marks; it simply serves to indicate that the content has been read and the marker has taken note of it. In our case, I'll read through the response and add stamps while taking mental notes of the whole answer.

- Once I have read the whole answer I will assign a mark. However, I am evaluating two separate aspects of the answer. Firstly, I'm evaluating grammar, and secondly I'm evaluating the actual argument structure. Grammer will count 4 marks and the argument strcuture will count 16.

- To add the mark for the grammar, I select the mark tool. In addition to specifying the marks, I also have the option to give details about the criterion being evaluated.

- For the argument structure I want to also add a custom comment, so I use the Comment Mark tool. Notice here I can specify the mark and criterion (as before), but I can also capture a comment.

At this point I'm completed the marking process, all that remains is to count up the marks. This is easily done using the "Count" tool.

When I click the count tool, the system first asks me for the assignment total and then automatically adds up all the assigned marks. 

The results are documented in a separate marking sheet which displays a breakdown table for all marks as well as some basic information about the date and marker.

At this stage, I can go back and adjust the marks and recount. Howver, in our case we are happy with the result and I will proceed to the next step: Finalising the PDF.

If I click the Finalise button, a secure copy of the PDF is created. This copy contains all the marks anbd the results sheet, but with two key differences:
 - It now have as extra page that combines all the comments made across the document
 - and
 - Marking is now disabled, i.e. I cannot add new marks to the document. 

That brings us to the end of a marking strategy that we call "Free form marking"

However, the PDF marking tool also supports another type of marking: Rubric-based marking.

Rubric based marking is handy for bulk-marking situations where the lecturer may be assisted my multiple teaching assistants who help to mark submissions. In such a situation it is likely that different assistents will apply different mental models while marking, leading to inconsistent marks.

To address this problem, a rubric is a structured document that gives clear guidance to a marker on how to mark each question.

To should how this works, I will open an unmarked copy of our demo assignment.

Once opened, I select the rubric to use before begining to mark.

Once the rubric is selected I can use the "Rubric Mark" tool, to add marks.

Notice, when I add the mark, the system pops up with a dialog. In this dialog is a dropdown list of elements being marked, a pre-configured list of potential options. For question 1 the possible options are correct or incorrect - However these values are configurable, you'll see something more advanced in question 5.

Once I select the option, the system automatically populates the marks as well as a default comment. As a marker, I may choose to adjust these if needed.

Once I add the mark, I can proceed to the next question. Notice that when I mark the next question, the system automagically knows to select question 2, because it tracks which  questions still need to be marked.

For demonstration purposes, let me finish the marking process.

Once all questions are marked I can simply count the marks as normal, but notice that the results screen now gives a much clearer breakdown of the marks and how they apply to each question.

So that covers the basics of both Free-form and rubric-based marking using the PDF marking tool.

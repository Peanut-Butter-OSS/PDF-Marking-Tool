# Installer Video

This is video 2 is a series of three videos that provide an introduction to installing and using the PDF marking tool. 
 - Video 1 covers installation of the tool
 - Video 2 (This video) covers basic usage of the tool, and
 - Video 3 explores the new Rubric marking functionality in the tool

Please take note: These videos apply only to v 2 and above of the markiung tool, since a large number of changes were introduced during the upgrade from v1.x to v2.x

The PDF marking tool was originally developed as an open source product with funding from the University of South Africa.

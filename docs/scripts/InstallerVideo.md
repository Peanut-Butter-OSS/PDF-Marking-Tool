Hello World

This is video 1 in a series of three videos that provide an introduction to installing and using the PDF marking tool. 
 - Video 1 (This video) covers installation of the tool
 - Video 2 covers basic usage of the tool, and
 - Video 3 explores the new Rubric marking functionality in the tool

Please take note: These videos apply only to v 2 and above of the marking tool, since a large number of changes were introduced during the upgrade from v1 to v2

The PDF marking tool was originally developed in 2009 as an open source product with funding from the University of South Africa. Since then there have been minor upgrades to stay aligned with changes in Operating Systems and the Adobe Acrobat platform. 

In 2020, with the assistance of Adobe and Learning Curve, we were able to secure funding for some much-needed functional enhancements to the product.

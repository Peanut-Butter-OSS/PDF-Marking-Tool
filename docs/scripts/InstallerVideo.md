Hello World

This is video 1 in a series of three videos that provide an introduction to installing and using the PDF marking tool. 
 - Video 1 (This video) covers installation of the tool
 - Video 2 covers basic usage of the tool, and
 - Video 3 explores the new Rubric marking functionality in the tool

Please take note: These videos apply only to v 2 and above of the marking tool, since a large number of changes were introduced during the upgrade from v1 to v2

The PDF marking tool was originally developed in 2009 as an open source product with funding from the University of South Africa. Since then there have been minor upgrades to stay aligned with changes in Operating Systems and the Adobe Acrobat platform. 

In 2020, with the assistance of Adobe and Learning Curve, we were able to secure funding for some much-needed functional enhancements to the product.

To use the PDF Marking tool there are two critical dependencies:

Firstly, the plug in is built for the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system, If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, you will not be able to use the marking tool.

Secondly, the PDF marking tool is built as a plug in for Adobe Acrobat Pro. You there much have Adobe Acrobat Pro installed in order to use the marking tool.

People often get confused between Adobe Acrobat Pro and the Free Adobe Acrobat Reader. To verify that you have Acrobat Pro, you can follow these steps:

 - Open Adobe Acrobat Pro
 - Click on the Help menu
 - Select the item "About Adobe Acrobat Pro DC"

Take note of the heading specifically stating "dobe Acrobat Pro DC"

Also note, that we are specifically using Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. In theory the Marking tool should also work with other versions of Acrobat Pro, but those have not bee formally tested, so we cannot guarantee that it will work as expected.

For the purposes of this video, we will assume that you have Adobe Acrobat Pro DC installed and that you are running a Windows 10 operating system.

Notice that the installation process includes a number of steps:
 - Checking whether you have Adobe Acrobat Pro DC installed
 - Copying the JAvascript code to your machine
 - Copying application resource files to your machine
 - Creating an uninstaller file, if you ever need to uninstall the marking tool.

Ideally, you should perform all the steps, but if your circumstances require, you could skip one or more steps.

Also notice that the tool allows you to adjust the location of the Javascripts folder, which is contained within your existing Acrobat Pro installation.

Ideally you should keep to the defaul here, unless your copy of Acrobat Pro has been installed in a non-standard location.
